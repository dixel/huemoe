## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Your Philips Hue system IP address;
- Developer token for your Hue system (can be obtained this way [link](https://developers.meethue.com/documentation/getting-started));
- Telegram API token (you would need to register a bot [link](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather);
- List of users to allow using this bot (Telegram user unique identifiers (those that start with @ usually));

```
docker run -d \
    -e HUE_HOST=<IP address of your Hue bridge> \
    -e HUE_TOKEN=<Hue developer token> \
    -e TELEGRAM_USER_WHITELIST=<Comma-separated list of allowed telegram users> \
    -e TELEGRAM_TOKEN=<Telegram developer token>
    dixel/huemoe:0.0.4.3
```

## Motivation
There are few telegram bots implemented in clojure, even though the development process
is full of joy:
- Controlling your lamp from REPl
- Asking your homemates to play with the bot and the lamp
- Having awesome clojure data structures and libraries for processing the state of the bot and the lights


### Try it with REPl

```clojure
(mount/start)
```
